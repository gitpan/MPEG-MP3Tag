NAME
    MPEG::MP3Tag - Manipulate / fetch TAG and header info from a MP3 audio
    file

SYNOPSIS
        #!perl -w
        use MPEG::MP3Tag;
        my $file = 'Pearls_Before_Swine.mp3';
        set_mp3tag($file, 'Pearls Before Swine', q"77's",
          'Sticks and Stones', '1990', q"(c) 1990 77's LTD.", 'rock & roll');

        my $tag = get_mp3tag($file) or die "No TAG info";
        $tag->{GENRE} = 'rock';
        set_mp3tag($file, $tag);

        my $info = get_mp3info($file);
        printf "$file length is %d:%d", $info->{MM}, $info->{SS};

DESCRIPTION
    set_mp3tag (FILE, TITLE, ARTIST, ALBUM, YEAR, COMMENT, GENRE)
    set_mp3tag (FILE, $HASHREF)
    Adds/changes tag information in an MP3 audio file. Will clobber any
    existing information in file. All fields have a 30-byte limit, except
    for YEAR, which has a four-byte limit.

    GENRE is a case-insensitive text string representing a genre found in
    `@mp3_genres'.

    Will accept either a list of values, or a hashref of the type returned
    by `get_mp3tag'.

    get_mp3tag (FILE)
    Returns hash reference containing tag information in MP3 file. Same
    info as described in `set_mp3tag'. You can't change this data.

    get_mp3info (FILE)
    Returns hash reference containing file information for MP3 file.

HISTORY
    v0.11, Friday, October 2, 1998
        Added `get_mp3info'. Thanks again to mp3tool source from Johann
        Lindvall, because I basically stole it straight (after converting
        it from C to Perl, of course).

        I did everything I could to find the header info, but if anyone
        has valid MP3 files that are not recognized, or has suggestions
        for improvement of the algorithms, let me know.

    v0.04, Tuesday, September 29, 1998
        Changed a few things, replaced a regex with an `unpack' (Meng Weng
        Wong <mengwong@pobox.com>).

    v0.03, Tuesday, September 8, 1998
        First public release.

    Helped me figure it all out.
